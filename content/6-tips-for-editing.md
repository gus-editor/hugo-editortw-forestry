### Editing Tips

1\. **Edit after you read, not during**. Ideally, I read the manuscript at least once before editing. If I do not have enough time, I still scan the entire paper before editing. This gives you a sense of the whole, which enables you not just to edit/revise/delete entire paragraphs but also to pinpoint where comments should be made. I also list down my comments as I edit. By the time I finish editing, I would have read the manuscript at least 4 times.

2\. **Talk to them**. Doctors always like it when they are taken seriously. So it is always good form to comment not just on what they need to do but on what they have done. For example, comments like “Your ABSTRACT is well written.” will go a long way, especially if the next comment is “Your INTRODUCTION is too long and repetitive.”

3\. **Think like them**. English is a hard enough language to master and for a people with an entirely different “alphabet” to use this together with medical jargon, it’s really a tall order. Also, most people (including doctors) write the way they talk. So when you encounter phrases or paragraphs that are totally undecipherable, read it out loud. It may help you get out of the rut. Unless impossible to understand, I usually stake my claim and revise the undecipherable, but I make sure to call the attention of the author to review the particular text and see if I got it right.

4\. **Keep a tab on your authors**. It helps to keep a mental note of your authors and their respective styles. There are authors whose names appear on the manuscript mainly because they are the department head honchos. These papers require extra care. For me, looking at the cover page already gives me an idea what lies ahead when I see certain authors. It also guides me as to how much relative importance I can give a certain paper.

5\. **Stamp your signature on your work**. It helps to have a specific way of doing things in terms of editing. I usually have my own specific way of doing the cover page, for instance, or how I format my paragraphs. For doctors/authors, it gives them a sense of your thoroughness. It also creates familiarity with your style. For me, it helps in terms of monitoring my work: if the authors “touched” my work. For instance, I immediately know if they added or revised something, or if they reverted to the original form rather than the edited version.

6\. **Keep your eye on the ball**. At the end of the day, what authors really want is a paper worthy of publication, at least in terms of the language. We want to impress upon them, through our comments, that we share this objective and this is why we are making comments. Keep this in mind when you are writing your comments. What we want them to do is to revise their paper based on our suggestions but what we state in our comments is that they should review their paper accordingly and decide on their own to revise or not. The endpoint is that they feel we have exerted all efforts to make their paper worthy of publication.
